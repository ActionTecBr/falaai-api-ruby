Official Ruby SDK for the **FalaAI API**.

## What is FalaAI API?

FalaAI API turns conversations into auditable business intelligence, in three steps:

1. **Transcribe** - audio (calls, voice notes, meetings) to text, with speaker separation.
2. **Diagnose** - summary, reason, recommended action, topic and sentiment per conversation.
3. **Audit compliance** - risk score and violations against **COPC CX** and **ISO 18295-1**.

It works with **phone calls and call recordings** (PABX IP, Asterisk, FreePBX, contact center),
**messaging** (WhatsApp, Telegram, web chat, SMS) and email - anything that can be turned into
text. Three REST endpoints, one API key, no setup.

## Who it's for

| Role | What they get |
| --- | --- |
| **Contact Center / Quality** | Audit 100% of conversations instead of a sample |
| **Compliance / Legal** | Forensic, auditable evidence for audits and disputes |
| **CX / Operations** | Risk score, sentiment and reason for every conversation |
| **Developers** | One typed SDK, three REST endpoints, one API key |
| **Data / BI** | Clean, typed JSON ready for your database or BI tool |

## Install

```bash
gem install falaai-api
```

## Quick start

```ruby
require "falaai-api"

config = FalaAI::Configuration.new
config.scheme = "https"
config.host = "api01-falaai.action.tec.br"
config.access_token = "fai_xxxxxx"

client = FalaAI::ApiClient.new(config)
speech = FalaAI::SpeechApi.new(client)

response, status = speech.create_transcription_v1_audio_transcriptions_post_with_http_info(
  File.open("call.mp3"),
  model: "falaai-transcribe-1", language: "pt"
)

puts response.text
```

## Use cases
